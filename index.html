	<h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
    <p>
      Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!
    </p>

      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
      through some interesting places on the way: 
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Walla Walla, WA<br> 
      Magic City, ID<br> 
      Bountiful, UT<br>
      Last Chance, CO<br>
      Truth or Consequences, NM<br>
      Why, AZ<br> 
    </blockquote>

    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
    <p>
      I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
      road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Passing cars, <br>
      When you can't see, <br>
      May get you, <br>
      A glimpse, <br>
      Of eternity. <br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I definitely won't be passing any cars.
    </p>

    <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>

    <p>
      My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
      everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
      I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      cellphone<br> 
      iPod<br>
      digital camera<br>
      and a protein bar<br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
       Just the essentials.  As
      Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a 
      thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
